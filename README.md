# ClassMate
ClassMate is a new feature that can be introduced to any social media application like GroupMe, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. to simplify the process of joining class groups and connecting with peers for students. The feature allows students to select their US college and enter their Class Registration Numbers (CRN) to automatically join the corresponding class groups. Currently, the focus is on developing the feature for Georgia Tech. ClassMate makes it easier for students to access vital resources and stay up-to-date with course materials.

## System architecture
ClassMate's system architecture uses HTML, CSS, and React for the frontend, Ruby for the backend, and Firebase for the database.

## Requirements for local runs
1. Clone the repository ```git clone https://github.com/rohanbatra4/ClassMate.git ```
2. Install any required dependencies for running React applications and a Ruby file
3. Run ```npm start``` in one terminal, and simultaneously run ```ruby retrieval.rb``` in another terminal.
4. Start using the web application!
