# ClassMate
ClassMate is a new feature being introduced to GroupMe to simplify the process of joining class groups and connecting with peers for students. The feature allows students to select their US college and enter their Class Registration Numbers (CRN) to automatically join the corresponding class groups. Currently, the focus is on developing the feature for Georgia Tech. ClassMate makes it easier for students to access vital resources and stay up-to-date with course materials.

## System architecture
ClassMate's system architecture uses HTML, CSS, and React for the frontend, Ruby on Rails for the backend, and Firebase for the database.
